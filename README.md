# Spaced-Selection 

This is a repository containing code and data for the paper: 

> U. Upadhyay, A. De, A. Zarezade, Bernhard Schölkopf, and M. Gomez-Rodriguez. [_Large-scale randomized experiment reveals machine learning helps people learn and remember more effectively._](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04430)

_Spaced Selection_ is a method for optimally selecting the items which the user should revise during a given session to optimize learning.

The modeling of human memory is based on our previous work, [Memorize](https://github.com/Networks-Learning/memorize), but instead of choosing the optimal time to review each item, in this work, we allow the user to select the session time and we choose the set of items which she will study during the session.

This repository consists of scripts for analysis of Spaced selection and baseline as well as code to run simulations to compare the performance of different item selection strategies.

The model was trained using data from the popular smart driving-learning app by [Swift](https://www.swift.ch/). The data on which the models were trained is not available.

To prepare, download all the `csv` files to the `data/` folder. An example file for 1 day of data has been added to the folder `data/spaced-algorithms`. An [IPython notebook](notebooks/Plots.ipynb) has been added to showcase the performance of the leraners for different algorithms.

Unless otherwise stated, the code should be run from the root folder.

The required files `DIFFICULTY_PARAMS` (an example included in `processed/`
folder) and `USER_SESSIONS_CSV` are produced by the `swift_to_hlr.py` script above.

The different version of the _Spaced-selection_ algorithm which can be
simulated are:

 - `SPACED_RANKING` chooses the top-`k` items in terms of forgetting probability (that depends on the current half-life factor) for each session deterministically, where `k` can be tuned/modified per session (produced by the simulator or sampled from real data).

 - `SPACED_SELECTION_DYN` chooses the `k` items probabilistically with each item's selection proportional to the probability of forgetting it (that depends on the current half-life factor) for each session, where `k` can be tuned/modified per session  (produced by the simulator or sampled from real data).

- `SPACED_SELECTION` samples `k` items at random proportionally to the forgetting probability (that depends on the current half-life factor) for each session, where `k` is set by the population average size of sessions.
